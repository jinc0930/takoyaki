Takoyaki is a friendly Discord bot built with the goal of spreading kindness, fun, and a little bit of chaos in your servers.  

For the longest time, I remembered using a “hug bot” that allowed people to send hugs to each other on Discord. During my toughest college years, that small gesture of kindness gave me a daily dose of positivity. When I looked for it again, I was surprised to find that nothing like it existed anymore.  

So, after countless searches (and frustrations), I decided: screw it—I’ll make my own. That’s how **Takoyaki** was born.  

At first, it was just hugs. But developing is addicting, and I couldn’t stop at a single feature. Takoyaki has since grown into a multi-featured companion with both wholesome and fun commands.
